/*
    Likes are proving to be a bit more challenging than I originally thought
    Problems:
        1. Primary_blog creates the likes, not the user profile
        2. Only one like can be created by a primary blog (could be solved when delete is working)
        3. Deleting a like (unlike), need to set it up so that likeId is not necessary,... 
            OR could find a way to keep track of the like.
