    Error validations -
        If certain fields within a form are not required,
        todo: then all required fields must be marked by a different CSS style or an asterisk (*) next to the label
         to indicate a required field.

    CSS Styling - 
        todo: Do not leave any default styling for HTML elements such as BUTTONS, INPUTS, TEXT AREA, etc.
        CSS must look as if you have made a valiant effort. 
            * You are not expected to be a designer, but attention to spacing, font, and layout must be apparent.
        Your site must be intuitive to the user. Users must not have to hunt and guess how to navigate and use your app.
